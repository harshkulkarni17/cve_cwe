A partial path traversal issue exists within the functions `load-file` and `load-resource`. These functions can be limited to load files from a list of load paths. Assuming Venice has been configured with the load paths: `[ \"\"/Users/foo/resources\"\" ]` When passing **relative** paths to these two vulnerable functions everything is fine: `(load-resource \"\"test.png\"\")` => loads the file \"\"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\"\" `(load-resource \"\"../resources-alt/test.png\"\")` => rejected, outside the load path When passing **absolute** paths to these two vulnerable functions Venice may return files outside the configured load paths: `(load-resource \"\"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\"\")` => loads the file \"\"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\"\" `(load-resource \"\"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\"\")` => loads the file \"\"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\"\" !!! The latter call suffers from the _Partial Path Traversal_ vulnerability. This issue\\'92s scope is limited to absolute paths whose name prefix matches a load path. E.g. for a load-path `\"\"/Users/foo/resources\"\"`, the actor can cause loading a resource also from `\"\"/Users/foo/resources-alt\"\"`, but not from `\"\"/Users/foo/images\"\"`.
